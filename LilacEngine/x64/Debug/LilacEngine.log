  assimp provides CMake targets:
  
    # this is heuristically generated, and may not be correct
    find_package(assimp CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE assimp::assimp)
  
  The package glew is compatible with built-in CMake targets:
  
      find_package(GLEW REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE GLEW::GLEW)
  
  glm provides CMake targets:
  
      find_package(glm CONFIG REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE glm::glm)
  
  The package opengl is compatible with built-in CMake targets via CMake v3.7 and prior syntax
  
      find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES})
      target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR})
  
  and the CMake v3.8 and beyond imported target syntax
  
      find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
      target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE OpenGL::GL)
  
  introduction of various components
  
      find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED COMPONENTS GL      # v3.8

  The OpenGL SDK is highly platform dependent and is usually an OS component. It's not realistic to build from source for every platform.
  
      WINDOWS: is part of the Windows SDK which this package installs.
      LINUX: the SDK may be installed from your distro's repo or from 3rd parties manually. There are too many to count.
      APPLE: consult your distribution vendor on the state of OpenGL support: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202823
